# Use Cases

This document describes basic use cases for Security Stack Mappings to ATT&CK. These use cases are expressed as user stories, and a short exploration of how a user story may be achieved follows each story.

## Use Cases â€” as a user of the Security Stack Mappings to ATT&CK...

### 1. I want to determine the (sub-)technique coverage of a control or set of controls

With control mappings implemented at a (sub-)technique level, this is as simple as following the mappings from the control(s) to the associated (sub-)techniques. Additionally, ATT&CK Navigator integration will easily support visualizations of such coverage.

In the context of this project, a mapping from a control to a (sub-)technique includes a score that communicates the effectiveness of the control in mitigating the (sub-)technique.  Additionally, most scores include comments describing the rational for assigning a particular score that should allow you to tailor the score to your environment.

For example, a particular control that detects threats to a database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offering may be scored as Minimal detection because its detection does not detect threats to databases installed on infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) components.  But in your environment, you may only be using the DBaaS offering; in that case you may want to consider adjusting the score of the control from Minimal to Partial or Significant to reflect the improved coverage with respect to your environment.

### 2. I want to know what security controls to select/implement in order to mitigate a specific set of (sub-)techniques

This is essentially the reverse direction of [use case 1](##1-i-want-to-determine-the-sub-technique-coverage-of-a-control-or-set-of-controls). 
This project produces an ATT&CK Navigator layer per platform, located in the `layers\platform.json` file, that aggregates the ATT&CK coverage of all the controls mapped for the platform into a single layer.  These layer files provide the reverse mapping of the information contained in a mapping file; rather than mapping a control to the set of (sub-)techniques that it mitigates, it provides a mapping for each (sub-technique) to the set of controls that mitigate it.  Use this layer file to search for the set of (sub-)techniques and the corresponding controls that provide a mitigation.

Additionally, this information can be visualized via the [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/).  Use your mouse to hover over a (sub-)technique in the tool and the list of controls that mitigate the (sub-technique) will be provided in the tooltip.

Because (sub-)techniques can map to multiple controls, it is likely that there will be multiple combinations of controls which could mitigate the (sub-)techniques. Given a way of ranking the possible solutions (e.g. minimize the number of controls, maximize the baseline-impact of controls) a dynamic programming algorithm can be implemented to determine the optimal set of controls required to mitigate the (sub-)techniques. 

### 3. I want to determine what security controls I can use to defend against a given group or software.

Groups and Software in ATT&CK are mapped to techniques. Therefore, this use case can be achieved by reviewing the set of (sub-)techniques that are associated with the group or software of interest and then exploring the set of security controls that mitigate those techniques. This then resolves to an extension of [use case 2](#2-i-want-to-know-what-security-controls-to-selectimplement-in-order-to-mitigate-a-specific-set-of-sub-techniques), where the set of (sub-)techniques is those associated with the software or group of interest. 

Additionally, this information can be visualized via the [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/). Load the Navigator layer for the control mappings of interest and then filter the layer by the group or software of interest to see just the (sub-)techniques of interest and their security control mappings.
