# Security Stack Mappings

This repository contains a collection of _native_ security controls mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® based on a common methodology and tool set. We aim to empower organizations with independent data on which _native_ security controls are most useful in defending against the adversary TTPs that they care about and establish a foundation for systematically mapping product security controls to ATT&CK. These mappings will allow organizations to make threat-informed decisions when selecting which native security capabilities to use.

## Get the Mappings

This project has produced mapping files for the following technology platforms, with more on the roadmap:
- Microsoft Azure
  - [HTML Summary](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/security-stack-mappings/Azure/README.html)
  - [YAML Mappings](mappings/Azure)
  - [JSON Navigator Layers](mappings/Azure/layers)
- AWS (in-progress)

## Supporting Resources

This project provides the following supporting resouces:
- **[Use Cases](docs/use_cases.md)** - There are several use cases for applying the mapping files to advance the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in threat-informed defense.
- **[Methodology](docs/mapping_methodology.md)** – A methodology for using the mapping data format and scoring rubric to produce mapping files for security controls native to a technology platform.  By providing a methodology, we hope to encourage a consistent, best-practice approach to performing mappings that will make mappings more comparable to each other. It also encourages community mappings to be developed – including, potentially, by security vendors themselves.
- **[Scoring Rubric](docs/scoring.md)** - A scoring rubric that enables assessing the effectiveness of a security control native to a technology platform in mitigating the set of ATT&CK techniques that it has been mapped to.  This scoring rubric enables providing a score for each (sub-)technique included in a security control's mapping file.
- **[Mapping data format](docs/mapping_format.md)** - The specification of a YAML file that captures the mapping of a security control native to a technology platform to the set of ATT&CK techniques that it mitigates.
- **[Mapping Tool](tools/)** – A Python-based tool that enables validating and producing [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/) layers for mapping files.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help advance threat-informed defense: 
- **Review the mappings, use them, and tell us what you think.**  We welcome your review and feedback on the mappings, our methodology, and resources.
- **Apply the methodology and share your security capability mappings.** We encourage organizations to apply our methodology to map the security capabilities of their products and we welcome mapping contributions.
- **Help us prioritize additional platforms to map.** Let us know what platforms you would like to see mapped to ATT&CK. Your input will help us prioritize how we expand our mappings.
- **Share your ideas.** We are interested in developing additional tools and resources to help the community understand and make threat-informed decisions in their risk management programs. If you have ideas or suggestions, we consider them as explore additional research projects.
