  Traffic Analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application
  activity in cloud networks. Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group
  (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud.  It can identify security
  threats to, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting
  internet access, and virtual machines (VM) connecting to rogue networks.
