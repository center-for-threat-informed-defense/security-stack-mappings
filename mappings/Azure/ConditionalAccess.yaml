  factors such as user, device, location, and real-time risk information to control what a specific

          Conditional Access can be used to enforce MFA for users which provides significant protection against 
          password compromises, requiring an adversary to complete an additional authentication method before
          their access is permitted.

              Conditional Access can be used to enforce MFA for users which can significantly reduce the impact of a
              password compromise, requiring an adversary to complete an additional authentication method before 
              their access is permitted.

          This control only provides minimal protection for this technique's procedure examples along and also only
          protects one of its sub-techniques resulting in an overall Minimal score.

              This control can protect against the abuse of valid cloud accounts by requiring MFA or
              blocking access altogether based on signals such as the user's IP location
              information, device compliance state, risky sign-in/user state (through integration
              with Azure AD Identity Protection).  Additionally, session controls that can limit
              what a valid user can do within an app can also be triggered based on the
              aforementioned triggers.

          This control only provides the ability to restrict file downloads for a limited set of
          applications and therefore its overall Coverage score is minimal.

              Conditional Access (CA), when granting (risky) users access to Office applications
              like SharePoint and OneDrive, can restrict what they can do in these applications
              using its app-enforced restrictions.   For example, it can enforce that users on
              unmanaged devices will have browser-only access to SharePoint/OneDrive with no ability
              to download, print, or sync files.  This can impede an adversary's ability to collect
              and stage files.  This offers minimal coverage as it requires the target
              application to support such a feature that can be triggered by this control and to
              date only a few (Office) applications support this.

          Conditional Access, when granting (risky) users access to cloud storage, specifically
          OneDrive, can restrict what they can do in these applications using its app-enforced
          restrictions.   For example, it can enforce that users on unmanaged devices will have
          browser-only access to OneDrive with no ability to download, print, or sync files.  This
          can impede an adversary's ability to exfiltrate data from OneDrive.  The protection
          coverage provided by this control is Minimal as it doesn't provide protection for other
          storage services available on Azure such as the Azure Storage service.

          This control only provides the ability to restrict an adversary from collecting valuable
          information for a limited set of applications (SharePoint, Exchange, OneDrive) and
          therefore its overall Coverage score is minimal.

              devices will have browser-only access to SharePoint with no ability to download,
              print, or sync files.  Furthermore, with its integration with Microsoft Cloud App
              Security, it can even restrict  cut, copy and paste operations.  This can impede an
              adversary's ability to collect valuable information and/or files from the
              application.   This protection is partial as it doesn't prohibit an adversary from
              potentially viewing sensitive information and manually collecting it, for example
              simply writing down information by hand.
comments: >-
  At first glance, this control seems mappable to Exfiltration (sub-)techniques but upon further
  analysis, it doesn't really mitigate exfiltration but rather its prerequisite Collection (sub-)techniques.
