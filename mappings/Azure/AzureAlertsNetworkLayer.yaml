  Security Center network-layer analytics are based on sample IPFIX data, which are packet headers
  collected by Azure core routers. Based on this data feed, Security Center uses machine learning
  models to identify and flag malicious traffic activities. Security Center also uses the Microsoft
  Threat Intelligence database to enrich IP addresses.

          Could identify connections to known malicious sites. Partial (arguably minimal) since must
          be on block list. No sub-techniques scored since not enough fidelity in the alert.

  Associated with Azure Security Center.

  The alerts can pick up outbound DOS, though that's not an ATT&CK technique per se (description
  oriented towards inbound DOS), also is a form of resource hijacking (though not in ATT&CK
  description, which is oriented towards cryptomining)
