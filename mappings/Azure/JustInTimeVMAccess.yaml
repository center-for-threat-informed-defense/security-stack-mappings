description: >-
  This control locks down inbound traffic to management ports for protocols such as RDP and SSH and
  only provides access upon request for a specified period of time. This reduces exposure to attacks
  while providing easy access when you need to connect to a virtual machine. Specific permissions
  are required to request access to virtual machines that have this control enabled and access can
  be requested through the Azure web UI, PowerShell, and a REST API.

          This control can be configured to completely block inbound access to selected ports until
          access is requested. This prevents any attempt at exploitation of a public-facing
          application unless the attacker has the credentials and permissions to request such
          access. Even if permission has been granted to an authorized user to access the virtual
          machine, a list of authorized IP addresses for that access can be configured.

          This control can be configured to completely block inbound access to selected ports until
          access is requested. This prevents any attempt at utilizing external remote services, such
          as RDP or a VPN, unless the attacker has the credentials and permissions to request such
          access. Even if permission has been granted to an authorized user to access the virtual
          machine, a list of authorized IP addresses for that access can be configured.

          This control can be configured to completely block inbound access to selected ports until
          access is requested. This prevents any attempt at brute forcing a protocol, such as RDP or
          SSH, unless the attacker has the credentials and permissions to request such access. Even
          if permission has been granted to an authorized user to access the virtual machine, a list
          of authorized IP addresses for that access can be configured.
