  Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that
  enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization.
  These resources include resources in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as
  Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.

          This control only provides protection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not
          providing any protection for the remaining and therefore its coverage score is Minimal,
          resulting in a Minimal score.

              This control's Access Review feature supports scheduling a routine review of cloud
              account permission levels to look for those that could allow an adversary to gain wide
              access.  This information can then be used to validate if such access is required and
              identify which (privileged) accounts should be monitored closely.  This reduces the
              availability of valid accounts to adversaries.  This review would
              normally be scheduled periodically, at most weekly, and therefore its temporal score
              is Partial.

          This control provides significant protection for some of this technique's sub-techniques
          while not providing any protection for others, resulting in a Partial score.
      - category: Detect
        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          This control only provides detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not
          providing any detection for the remaining and therefore its coverage score is Minimal,
          resulting in a Minimal score.

              This control can require MFA to be triggered when the Global Administrator role is
              assigned to an account or when the role is activated by a user.
          - category: Detect
            value: Significant
            comments: >-
              This control can notify administrators whenever the Global Administrator role is
              assigned to an account and can therefore be used to detect the execution of this
              sub-technique.  Assigning the Global Administrator role to an account is an infrequent
              operation and as a result, the false positive rate should be minimal.

              Privileged roles such as the Application Administrator role can be configured to
              require MFA on activation to provide additional protection against the execution of
              this technique.  In addition these privileged roles can be assigned as eligible rather
              than permanently active roles to further reduce the attack surface.
