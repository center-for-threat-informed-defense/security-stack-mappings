description: >-
  Azure Defender detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Key Vault
  accounts. When anomalous activities occur, Azure Defender shows alerts and optionally sends them
  via email to relevant members of your organization. These alerts include the details of the
  suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

          This control may alert on suspicious access of key vaults, including suspicious listing of
          key vault contents. This control does not alert on discovery of other cloud services, such
          as VMs, snapshots, cloud storage and therefore has minimal coverage. Suspicious activity
          based on patterns of access from certain users and applications allows for managing false
          positive rates.

          This control may detect suspicious secret access from Azure key vaults. This does not apply
          to any sub-techniques under T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores but Azure Key Vault
          can be treated as a store for passwords, keys, and certificates. The coverage of this
          control could be deemed high for cloud credential and secret storage within Key Vault but
          is not applicable to traditional password stores, such as password managers, keychain, or
          web browsers. 
comments: >-
  This control provides alerts for suspicious activity for Azure Key Vault. Documentation has been
  offered on how to respond to alerts but no specific tool or feature is offered for response.
