          This control provides partial detection for some of this technique's sub-techniques and
          procedure examples resulting in an overall Partial detection score.

          This control provides a response capability that accompanies its detection capability that
          can contain and eradicate the impact of this technique.  Because this capability varies
          between containment (federated accounts) and eradication (cloud accounts) and is only able to
          respond to some of this technique's sub-techniques, it has been scored as Partial.

              This control provides risk detections that can be used to detect suspicious uses of
              valid accounts, e.g.:  Anonymous IP address, Atypical travel, Malware linked IP
              address, Unfamiliar sign-in properties, etc.  Microsoft utilizes machine learning and
              heuristic systems to reduce the false positive rate but there will be false positives.

              The temporal factor of this control's detection is low because although there are some
              real-time detections most are offline detections (multi-day).

              Response Type:  Eradication

              Supports blocking and resetting the user's credentials based on the detection of a
              risky user/sign-in manually and also supports automation via its user and sign-in risk
              policies.

              When Azure Active Directory (AAD) Federation is configured for a tenant, an adversary
              that compromises a domain credential can use it to access (Azure) cloud resources.
              Identity Protection supports applying its risk detections (e.g.:  Anonymous IP
              address, Atypical travel, Malware linked IP address, Unfamiliar sign-in properties,
              etc.) to federated identities thereby providing detection mitigation for this risk.
              Because this detection is specific to an adversary utilizing valid domain credentials
              to access cloud resources and does not mitigate the usage of valid domain credentials
              to access on-premise resources, this detection has been scored as Partial.


              The temporal factor of this control's detection is low because although there are some
              real-time detections most are offline detections (multi-day).

              Response Type:  Containment

              Supports risk detection responses such as blocking a user's access and enforcing MFA.
              These responses contain the impact of this sub-technique but do not eradicate it (by
              forcing a password reset).

          This control can be effective at detecting forged web credentials because it uses
          environmental properties (e.g. IP address, device info, etc.) to detect risky users and
          sign-ins even when valid credentials are utilized.  It provides partial coverage of this
          technique's sub-techniques and therefore has been assessed a Partial score.

              This control supports detecting risky sign-ins and users that involve federated users
              and therefore can potentially alert on this activity.  Not all alert types for this
              control support federated accounts therefore the detection coverage for this technique
              is partial.

          This control provides Minimal detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while
          not providing any detection for the remaining, resulting in a Minimal score.

          Provides significant response capabilities for one of this technique's sub-techniques
          (Password Spray).  Due to this capability being specific to one of its sub-techniques and
          not its remaining sub-techniques, the coverage score is Minimal resulting in an overall
          Minimal score.

              This control specifically provides detection of Password Spray attacks for Azure
              Active Directory accounts.  Microsoft documentation states that this detection is
              based on a machine learning algorithm that has been improved with the latest
              improvement yielding a 100 percent increase in recall and  98 percent precision.  The
              temporal factor for this detection is Partial as its detection is described as offline
              (i.e. detections may not show up in reporting for two to twenty-four hours).
