              This control may quarantine and/or delete any spearphishing attachment that has been
              downloaded and matches a malware signature. Customized malware without a matching
              signature may not generate an alert.

              This control monitors activity in cloud services and on virtual machines to block
              malware execution. This is dependent on a signature being available.

              This control may quarantine and/or delete malware that has been packed by well known
              software packing utilities. These utilities can provide signatures that apply to a
              variety of malware.

comments: >-
  Signature based antimalware solutions are generally dependent on Indicators of Compromise(IOCs)
  such as file hashes and malware signatures. ATT&CK is primarily centered on behaviors and
  Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures(TTPs), hence the minimal amount of techinques and scoring.
