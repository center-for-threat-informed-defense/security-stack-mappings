          This control may provide recommendations to secure external remote services, such as
          restricting SSH access, enabling multi-factor authentication for VPN access, and auditing
          external remote services that are not necessary or updated.

          This control may provide recommendations to restrict access to cloud resources from public
          networks and to route traffic between resources through Azure. Recommendations are also
          provided to use private DNS zones. If these recommendations are implemented the visible
          network information should be reduced.

              This control may recommend removing deprecated accounts, reducing privileges, and
              enabling multi-factor authentication. This can reduce the amount of accounts available
              to be exploited and  what could be done with those accounts.
