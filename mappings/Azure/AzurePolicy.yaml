          This control may provide recommendations to restrict access to cloud resources from public
          networks and to route traffic between resources through Azure. Recommendations are also
          provided to use private DNS zones. If these recommendations are implemented the visible
          network information should be reduced.

comments: 'This mapping is focused on the list of built-in policy definitions provided by Azure Policy.
           All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than
           applying/enforcing the recommended actions.'
