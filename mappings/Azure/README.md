# Introduction


This page enumerates the native security controls available on the Azure platform that have been mapped to [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/).  <br>Most controls included in scope were derived from the [Azure Security Benchmark (v2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) and our own independent research.

[Aggregate Navigator Layer For All Controls](layers/platform.json)
# Controls

## 1. Adaptive Application Controls


Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on machines and create a list of known-safe software. Allow lists are based on specific Azure workloads and can be further customized. They are based on trusted paths, publishers, and hashes. When Adaptive Application Controls are enabled, security alerts are generated when applications are run that have not been defined as safe.

### Technique(s)

|Technique|Category|Value|Comment|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|[T1036 - Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/)|Detect|Partial|This control provides detection for some of this technique's sub-techniques and procedure examples and therefore its coverage score is Partial, resulting in a Partial score. Its detection occurs once every twelve hours, so its temporal score is also Partial.|
|[T1204 - User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/)|Detect|Partial|This control only provides detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not providing any detection capability for its other sub-technique, and therefore its coverage score is Partial, resulting in a Partial score.|
|[T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/)|Detect|Minimal|This control only provides detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not providing any detection capability for the remaining sub-techniques, and therefore its coverage score is Minimal, resulting in a Minimal score.|
|[T1554 - Compromise Client Software Binary](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554/)|Detect|Partial|Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that is run and is not included in an allow list. While name and publisher-based allow lists may fail to detect malicious modifications to executable client binaries, hash-based rules will still detect untrusted executables. Events are calculated once every twelve hours, so its temporal score is Partial.|

- [Mapping File](AlertsForAzureCosmosDB.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AlertsForAzureCosmosDB.json)

### Mapping Comments


This control is still in preview, so its coverage will likely expand in the future. This mapping is based on its current (preview) state.  


### Technique(s)

|Technique|Category|Value|Comment|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|[T1078 - Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)|Detect|Minimal|This control's detection is specific to the Cosmos DB and therefore provides minimal overall detection coverage for Valid Accounts resulting in a Minimal score. A relevant alert is "Access from an unusual location to a Cosmos DB account".|
|[T1213 - Data from Information Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/)|Detect|Minimal|This control triggers an alert when an unusually large amount of data is extracted from/by an account compared to recent activity. False positives are fairly likely and extraction in quantities below the control's threshold is not detected, so score is Minimal. Neither of the sub-techniques are relevant in this context, since they are repository-specific.  Relevant alert is "Unusual amount of data extracted from a Cosmos DB account"|

### Technique(s)

|Technique|Category|Value|Comment|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|[T1078 - Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)|Detect|Partial|This control provides partial detection for some of this technique's sub-techniques and procedure examples resulting in an overall Partial detection score.|
|[T1078 - Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)|Respond|Partial|This control provides a response capability that accompanies its detection capability that can contain and eradicate the impact of this technique.  Because this capability varies between containment (federated accounts) and eradication (cloud accounts) and is only able to respond to some of this technique's sub-techniques, it has been scored as Partial.|
|[T1110 - Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/)|Detect|Minimal|This control provides Minimal detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not providing any detection for the remaining, resulting in a Minimal score.|
|[T1110 - Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/)|Respond|Minimal|Provides significant response capabilities for one of this technique's sub-techniques (Password Spray).  Due to this capability being specific to one of its sub-techniques and not its remaining sub-techniques, the coverage score is Minimal resulting in an overall Minimal score.|
|[T1606 - Forge Web Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/)|Detect|Partial|This control can be effective at detecting forged web credentials because it uses environmental properties (e.g. IP address, device info, etc.) to detect risky users and sign-ins even when valid credentials are utilized.  It provides partial coverage of this technique's sub-techniques and therefore has been assessed a Partial score.|
|[T1606 - Forge Web Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/)|Respond|Partial|Provides Significant response capabilities for one of this technique's sub-techniques (SAML tokens).|

## 7. Azure AD Identity Secure Score


The identity secure score is a percentage that functions as an indicator for how aligned you are with Microsoft's best practice recommendations for security. Each improvement action in Identity Secure Score is tailored to your specific configuration.  The score helps you to:  Objectively measure your identity security posture, plan identity security improvements, and review the success of your improvements.  
Every 48 hours, Azure looks at your security configuration and compares your settings with the recommended best practices. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, a new score is calculated for your directory.

- [Mapping File](AzureADIdentitySecureScore.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzureADIdentitySecureScore.json)

### Mapping Comments


This control was mapped to (sub-)techniques based on the Security Score improvement actions listed in a sample Azure AD tenant that we provisioned.  We were unable to find a comprehensive list of the security checks made by the control listed in its documentation.  We did note that there were some improvement actions listed that our tenant received the max score, leading us to believe that the actions listed were the complete list of checks and not just those that were outstanding for our tenant.
The following improvement actions were analyzed:
Require MFA for administrative roles, Designate more than one global admin,  Do not allow users to grant consent to unmanaged applications, Use limited administrative roles, Do not expire passwords, Enable policy to block legacy authentication  Turn on sign-in risk policy, Turn on user risk policy, Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access, Enable self-service password reset, Resolve unsecure account attributes, Reduce lateral movement path risk to sensitive entities,  Set a honeytoken account, Stop clear text credentials exposure, Install Defender for Identity Sensor on all Domain Controllers,  Disable Print spooler service on domain controllers, Configure VPN integration,  Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Integration (*excluded, would increase the scope, see mapping for Microsoft  Defender for Endpoint), Stop legacy protocols communication, Stop weak cipher usage,  Remove dormant accounts from sensitive groups, Protect and manage local admin passwords with Microsoft LAPS,  Remove unsecure SID history attributes from entities, Fix Advanced Audit Policy issues, Modify unsecure Kerberos  delegations to prevent impersonation. 
All scores were capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than applying/enforcing the recommended actions.

## 8. Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication


Multi-factor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification, such as to enter a code on their cellphone or to provide a fingerprint scan.
If you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If  the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, is it really the user signing in with the  username and password, or is it an attacker? When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased as this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to  obtain or duplicate.

- [Mapping File](AzureADMultiFactorAuthentication.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzureADMultiFactorAuthentication.json)

### Mapping Comments


Note that MFA that is triggered in response to privileged operations (such as assigning a user a privileged role) are considered functionality of the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management control.  Consult the mapping for this control for the ATT&CK (sub-)techniques it maps to.  This mapping specifically deals with MFA when it is enabled as a security default.

## 9. Azure AD Password Policy


A password policy is applied to all user accounts that are created and managed directly in Azure Active Directory (AD). Some of these password policy settings can't be modified, though you can configure custom banned passwords for Azure AD password protection or account lockout parameters.

- [Mapping File](AzureADPasswordPolicy.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzureADPasswordPolicy.json)

### Mapping Comments


Most scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases the strength of user passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful brute force attack.  But given sufficient resources, an adversary may still successfully execute the attack vectors included  in this mapping.

## 11. Azure Active Directory Password Protection


Azure AD Password Protection detects and blocks known weak passwords and their variants,  and can also block additional weak terms that are specific to your organization. Azure AD Password Protection provides a global banned password list that is automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant.  The Azure AD Identity Protection team constantly analyzes Azure AD security telemetry data looking for commonly used weak or compromised passwords.  When weak terms are found, they're added to the global banned password list. To support your own business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned  password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned  password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.


- [Mapping File](AzureADPasswordProtection.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzureADPasswordProtection.json)

### Mapping Comments


All scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases the strength of user passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful brute force attack.  Due to the fact that a user's password is not checked  against the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their  password (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity  for attackers to utilize this technique to gain access. This is what prevented the score from being elevated to Significant.

## 12. Azure Alerts for Network Layer


Security Center network-layer analytics are based on sample IPFIX data, which are packet headers collected by Azure core routers. Based on this data feed, Security Center uses machine learning models to identify and flag malicious traffic activities. Security Center also uses the Microsoft Threat Intelligence database to enrich IP addresses.

- [Mapping File](AlertsNetworkLayer.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AlertsNetworkLayer.json)

### Mapping Comments


Associated with the Azure Security Center.
The alerts can pick up outbound Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, though that's not an ATT&CK technique  per se (description oriented towards inbound DOS), also is a form of resource hijacking (though not in ATT&CK description, which is oriented towards cryptomining).

## 27. Azure Network Traffic Analytics


Traffic Analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks. Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud.  It can identify security threats to, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting internet access, and virtual machines (VM) connecting to rogue networks.

## 28. Azure Policy


Azure Policy evaluates resources in Azure by comparing the properties of those resources to business rules. These business rules, described in JSON format, are known as policy definitions. Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale.

- [Mapping File](AzurePolicy.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzurePolicy.json)

### Mapping Comments


This mapping is focused on the list of built-in policy definitions provided by Azure Policy. All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than applying/enforcing the recommended actions.

## 29. Azure Private Link


Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network.
Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers. Setup and consumption using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned, and shared partner services.

- [Mapping File](AzurePrivateLink.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzurePrivateLink.json)

### Mapping Comments


This is a private network service, allowing connections between Azure, on-prem, and 3rd party services without traversing the Internet. Generally this reduces risk from MiTM, DOS, network-based data manipulation and network sniffing from untrusted network.

## 30. Azure Security Center Recommendations


This feature of Azure Security Center assesses your workloads and raises threat prevention recommendations and security alerts.

- [Mapping File](SecurityCenterRecommendations.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/SecurityCenterRecommendations.json)

### Mapping Comments


Security Center recommendations include recommendations to enable security controls that have already been mapped separately (e.g. "Azure Defender for App Service should be enabled").    Rather than including the (sub-)techniques that these controls map to within this mapping, consult the mapping files for these controls.  To make this latter task easier, we have tagged all such controls with the "Azure Security Center Recommendation" tag.
All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than applying/enforcing the recommended actions.
IoT related recommendations were not included in this mapping.

## 35. Conditional Access


"Conditional access enables organizations to configure and fine-tune access policies with contextual factors such as user, device, location, and real-time risk information to control what a specific user can access, and how and when they have access."

- [Mapping File](ConditionalAccess.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/ConditionalAccess.json)

### Mapping Comments


At first glance, this control seems mappable to Exfiltration (sub-)techniques but upon further analysis, it doesn't really mitigate exfiltration but rather its prerequisite Collection (sub-)techniques.

|[T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage Object](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530/)|Protect|Minimal|Conditional Access, when granting (risky) users access to cloud storage, specifically OneDrive, can restrict what they can do in these applications using its app-enforced restrictions.   For example, it can enforce that users on unmanaged devices will have browser-only access to OneDrive with no ability to download, print, or sync files.  This can impede an adversary's ability to exfiltrate data from OneDrive.  The protection coverage provided by this control is Minimal as it doesn't provide protection for other storage services available on Azure such as the Azure Storage service.|

## 36. Continuous Access Evaluation


Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) provides the next level of identity security by terminating active user sessions to a subset of Microsoft services (Exchange and Teams) in real-time on changes such as account disable, password reset, and admin initiated user revocation.  CAE aims to improve the response time in situations where a policy setting that applies to a user changes but the user is able to circumvent the new policy setting because their OAuth access token was issued before the policy change.  It's typical that security access tokens issued by Azure AD, like OAuth 2.0 access tokens, are valid for an hour.
CAE enables the scenario where users lose access to organizational SharePoint Online files, email, calendar, or tasks, and Teams from Microsoft 365 client apps within minutes after critical security events (such as user account is deleted, MFA is enabled for a user, High user risk detected by Azure AD Identity Protection, etc.).

## 37. Docker Host Hardening


Azure Security Center identifies unmanaged containers hosted on IaaS Linux VMs, or other Linux machines running Docker containers. Security Center continuously assesses the configurations of these containers. It then compares them with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark. Security Center includes the entire ruleset of the CIS Docker Benchmark and alerts you if your containers don't satisfy any of the controls. When it finds misconfigurations, Security Center generates security recommendations.

- [Mapping File](DockerHostHardening.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/DockerHostHardening.json)

### Mapping Comments


All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than applying/enforcing the recommended actions.

## 38. File Integrity Monitoring


File integrity monitoring (FIM), also known as change monitoring, examines operating system files, Windows registries, application software, Linux system files, and more, for changes that might indicate an attack. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) informs you when changes occur to sensitive areas in your resources, so you can investigate and address unauthorized activity. 


- [Mapping File](FileIntegrityMonitoring.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/FileIntegrityMonitoring.json)

### Mapping Comments


The techniques included in this mapping result in Windows Registry or file system artifacts being created or modified which can be detected by this control.  
The detection score for most techniques included in this mapping was scored as Significant and where there are exceptions, comments have been provided. This Significant score assessment  was due to the following factors: Coverage - (High) The control was able to detect most of the sub-techniques, references and procedure examples of the mapped techniques. Accuracy - (High) Although this control does not include built-in intelligence to minimize  the false positive rate, the specific artifacts generated by the techniques in this mapping do not change frequently and therefore the potential for a high false-positive is reduced.  Temporal - (Medium) This control at worst scans for changes on an hourly basis.

### Mapping Comments


Understandably (to avoid enabling adversaries to circumvent the detection), many of the detections provided by this control do not provide a detailed description of the detection logic making it often times difficult to map to ATT&CK Techniques.

Adding users is done to gain access to more resources, and gain persistency.  This detection relies on profiling the group modification activities of users, and alerting when an abnormal addition to a sensitive group is observed. Defender for Identity profiles continuously. <br/>This alert provides Partial coverage of this technique with a reduced false-positive rate by utilizing machine learning models.|

## 45. Network Security Groups


You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

- [Mapping File](NetworkSecurityGroups.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/NetworkSecurityGroups.json)

### Mapping Comments


Note: one can employ Application Security Groups (ASG) in Network Security Group (NSG) rules to map  rules to workloads etc. Not scoring ASG as a separate control. One can employ Adaptive Network Hardening (ANH)  to generate recommended NSG rules based on traffic, known trusted configuration, threat intelligence, and other inidcators of compromise. Not scoring ANH as a separate control.

## 46. Passwordless Authentication


Features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) are a great way to secure your organization, but users often get frustrated with the additional security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. Passwordless authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have, plus something you are or something you know.

## 47. Role Based Access Control


Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that is using the cloud. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to.


- [Mapping File](AzureADRoleBasedAccessControl.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/AzureADRoleBasedAccessControl.json)

### Mapping Comments


RBAC enables organizations to limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative privileges.  This enables limiting the number of users within the tenant that have privileged access thereby resulting in a reduced attack surface and a coverage score factor of Partial.  Most sub-techniques have been scored as Partial for this reason.

## 48. SQL Vulnerability Assessment


SQL vulnerability assessment is a service that provides visibility into your security state. The service employs a knowledge base of rules that flag security vulnerabilities. It highlights deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data.

- [Mapping File](SQLVulnerabilityAssessment.yaml)
- [Navigator Layer](layers/SQLVulnerabilityAssessment.json)

### Mapping Comments


All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than applying/enforcing the recommended actions.
