          This control provides minimal detection coverage for the only relevant sub-technique so
          score is Minimal.

              This control triggers an alert when there is a change in the access pattern to an
              Azure Cosmos account based on access from an unusual geographical location. False
              positives are fairly likely and misuse from a typical location is not covered, so
              score is Minimal.

          This control triggers an alert when an unusually large amount of data is extracted from/by
          an account compared to recent activity. False positives are fairly likely and extraction
          in quantities below the control's threshold is not detected, so score is Minimal. Neither
          of the sub-techniques are relevant in this context, since they are repository-specific.
comments: >-
  This control is still in preview, so its coverage will likely expand in the future. This mapping
  is based on its current (preview) state.
