          This control can prevent the gathering of victim network information via scanning methods but is not
          effective against methods such as Phishing resulting in a Partial coverage score and an overall
          Partial score.

              This control can prevent attempts by an adversary to gather this information using active scanning methods
              but is not effective of gathering this information using phishing related methods.

              This control's threat intelligence-based filtering feature can be enabled to alert
              and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses
              and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.  Because this
              protection is limited to known malicious IP addresses and domains and does not provide
              protection from such attacks from unknown domains and IP addresses, this is scored as
              partial coverage resulting in an overall Partial score.

          This control provides partial protection for this technique's sub-techniques and procedure examples

          - category: Protect
            value: Partial
            comments: >-
              This control can protect against this sub-technique by enforcing limited access to only
              required ports.  Consequently, even if the adversary is able to utilize port knocking to
              open additional ports at the host level, it is still blocked at the firewall service level.
              This service typically applies to external traffic and not internal traffic and therefore
              lateral movement using this technique within a network is still possible.  Due to this
              partial coverage, it has been scored as Partial.

    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          This control typically filters external network traffic and therefore can be effective for preventing
          external network service scanning but network service scanning originating from inside the trusted
          network is not mitigated.  Due to this partial protection coverage, it has been scored as Partial protection.

    name: Remote System Discovery
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          This control typically filters external network traffic and therefore can be effective for preventing
          external remote system discovery but such activity originating from inside the trusted network is
          not mitigated.  Due to this partial protection coverage, it has been scored as Partial protection.

          This control's threat intelligence-based filtering feature can be enabled to alert
          and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses
          and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.  Because this
          protection is limited to known malicious IP addresses and domains and does not provide
          protection from such attacks from unknown domains and IP addresses, this is scored as
          partial coverage resulting in an overall Partial score.

          This control's threat intelligence-based filtering feature can be enabled to alert
          and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses
          and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.  Because this

          protection from such attacks from unknown domains and IP addresses, this is scored as
          partial coverage resulting in an overall Partial score.

          Furthermore, it can be used to filter non-application layer protocol traffic such as ICMP.

    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Significant
        comments: >-
          This control can limit access to the minimum required ports and therefore protect against adversaries
          attempting to use non-standard ports for C2 traffic.
  - id: T1219
    name: Remote Access Software
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Partial
        comments: >-
          This control can be used to limit outgoing traffic to only sites and services used by authorized
          remote access tools.  This is scored as partial because it doesn't protect against an adversary
          using an authorized remote access tool for malicious activity.
