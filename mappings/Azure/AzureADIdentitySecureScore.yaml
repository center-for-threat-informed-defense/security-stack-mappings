  The identity secure score is a percentage that functions as an indicator for how aligned you are
  with Microsoft's best practice recommendations for security. Each improvement action in Identity
  Secure Score is tailored to your specific configuration.  The score helps you to:  Objectively
  measure your identity security posture, plan identity security improvements, and review the success of
  your improvements.  

  Every 48 hours, Azure looks at your security configuration and compares your settings with the
  recommended best practices. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, a new score is calculated for
  your directory.

          The MFA recommendation provides significant protection against password compromises, but
          because this is a recommendation and doesn't actually enforce MFA, the assessed score is
          capped at Partial.

              This control's "Require MFA for administrative roles" and "Ensure all users can
              complete multi-factor authentication for secure access" recommendations for enabling
              MFA can significantly lead to reducing the impact of a password compromise of
              accounts, requiring the adversary to complete an additional authentication method
              before their access is permitted.

              This control's "Do not expire passwords" recommendation also can lead to mitigating the
              Password Guessing or Cracking sub-techniques by disabling password reset which tends to
              lead to users selecting weaker passwords.  

              This control's "Enable policy to block legacy authentication" and "Stop legacy
              protocols communication" recommendations can lead to protecting against these brute
              force attacks as Microsoft research has shown organizations that have disabled
              legacy authentication experience 67 percent fewer compromises than those where legacy
              authentication is enabled. Additionally, the same research shows that more than 99
              percent of password spray and more than 97 percent of credential stuffing attacks
              use legacy authentication.

              This control's "Resolve unsecure account attributes" recommendation can lead to detecting
              accounts with disabled (Kerberos) Preauthentication which can enable offline Password Cracking.

              Because these are recommendations and do not actually enforce MFA, the assessed score
              is capped at Partial.

              This control's "Require MFA for administrative roles" and "Ensure all users can
              complete multi-factor authentication for secure access" recommendations of MFA can
              provide protection against an adversary that obtains valid credentials by requiring
              the adversary to complete an additional authentication process before access is
              permitted.  See the mapping for MFA for more details.  

              This control's "Use limited administrative roles" recommendation recommends reviewing
              and limiting the number of accounts with global admin privilege, reducing what an
              adversary can do with a compromised valid account.

              Because these are recommendations and do not actually enforce the protections, the

              This control's "Remove dormant accounts from sensitive groups" recommendation
              recommends reviewing dormant (domain) accounts from sensitive groups via an assessment
              report that can identify sensitive accounts that are dormant.

              Because these are recommendations and do not actually enforce the protections coupled

              recommendation recommends periodically running and reviewing the Microsoft LAPS usage
              report that identifies all Windows based devices not protected by Microsoft LAPS. 
              This can help reduce the compromise of local administrator accounts.

          This control's "Do not allow users to grant consent to unmanaged applications"
          recommendation can protect against an adversary constructing a malicious application
          designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token by ensuring
          users can not be fooled into granting consent to the application.

              This control's "Resolve unsecure account attributes" recommendation can lead to
              detecting Active Directory accounts which do not require Kerberos preauthentication. 
              Preauthentication offers protection against offline (Kerberos) Password Cracking.

              It recommends running the Lateral-Movement-Paths report to understand and identify

              recommendation promotes running the "Unsecure Kerberos delegation" report that can
              identify accounts that have unsecure Kerberos delegation configured.  Unsecured
              Kerberos delegation can lead to exposing account TGTs to more hosts resulting in an

          any entities exposing credentials in clear text (via LDAP simple-bind).  This assessment

comments: >-
  This control was mapped to (sub-)techniques based on the Security Score improvement actions listed
  in a sample Azure AD tenant that we provisioned.  We were unable to find a comprehensive list of
  the security checks made by the control listed in its documentation.  We did note that there were
  some improvement actions listed that our tenant received the max score, leading us to believe that
  the actions listed were the complete list of checks and not just those that were outstanding for
  our tenant.

  The following improvement actions were analyzed:

  Require MFA for administrative roles, Designate more than one global admin, 
  Do not allow users to grant consent to unmanaged applications,
  Use limited administrative roles, Do not expire passwords, Enable policy to block legacy authentication 
  Turn on sign-in risk policy, Turn on user risk policy, Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access,
  Enable self-service password reset, Resolve unsecure account attributes, Reduce lateral movement path risk to sensitive entities, 
  Set a honeytoken account, Stop clear text credentials exposure, Install Defender for Identity Sensor on all Domain Controllers, 
  Disable Print spooler service on domain controllers, Configure VPN integration, 
  Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Integration (*excluded, would increase the scope, see mapping for Microsoft 
  Defender for Endpoint), Stop legacy protocols communication, Stop weak cipher usage, 
  Remove dormant accounts from sensitive groups, Protect and manage local admin passwords with Microsoft LAPS, 
  Remove unsecure SID history attributes from entities, Fix Advanced Audit Policy issues, Modify unsecure Kerberos 
  delegations to prevent impersonation. 

  All scores were capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than applying/enforcing the recommended actions.
