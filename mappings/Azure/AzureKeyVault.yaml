  Azure Key Vault provides a way to store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates used throughout
  Azure and for internally connected resources. This control allows for fine grained permissions for
  authentication and authorization for access while providing monitoring for all activity with the
  key vault.

          This control can provide protection against attackers stealing application access tokens
          if they are stored within Azure Key Vault. Key vault significantly raises the bar for
          access for stored tokens by requiring legitimate credentials with proper authorization.
          Applications may have to be modified to take advantage of Key Vault and may not always be
          possible to utilize.

          This control may provide a more secure location for storing passwords. If an Azure user
          account, endpoint, or application is compromised, they may have limited access to
          passwords stored in the Key Vault.

          This control provides a central, secure location for storage of credentials to reduce the
          possibility of attackers discovering unsecured credentials.

          This control provides secure methods for accessing secrets and passwords. This can reduce
          the incidences of credentials and other authentication material being transmitted in plain
          text or by insecure encryption methods. Any communication between applications or
          endpoints after access to Key Vault may not be secure.
