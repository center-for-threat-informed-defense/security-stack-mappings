description: >-
  Security Center's Adaptive Application Controls uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on machines and create a
  list of known-safe software. Allow lists are based on specific Azure workloads and can be further
  customized. They are based on trusted paths, publishers, and hashes. When Adaptive Application
  Controls are enabled, security alerts are generated when applications are run that have not been
  defined as safe.

          This control only provides detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not
          providing any detection capability for its other sub-technique, and therefore its coverage
          score is Partial, resulting in a Partial score.

              Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that has been
              run and is not included in an allow list. There is a significant potential for false
              positives from new non-malicious executables, and events are calculated once every
              twelve hours, so its temporal score is Partial.

          This control provides detection for some of this technique's sub-techniques and procedure
          examples and therefore its coverage score is Partial, resulting in a Partial score. Its
          detection occurs once every twelve hours, so its temporal score is also Partial.

              Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that is run and
              is not included in an allow list. Path-based masquerading may subvert path-based rules
              within this control, resulting in false negatives, but hash and publisher-based rules
              will still detect untrusted executables. Events are calculated once every twelve
              hours, so its temporal score is Partial.

              Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that is run and
              is not included in an allow list. Malicious files of this type would be unlikely to
              evade detection from any form of allow list. Events are calculated once every twelve
              hours, so its temporal score is Partial.

              Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that is run and
              is not included in an allow list. Because signatures generated via this technique are
              not valid, these malicious executables would be detected via any form of allow list,
              including publisher-based. Events are calculated once every twelve hours, so its
              temporal score is Partial.

          This control only provides detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not
          providing any detection capability for the remaining sub-techniques, and therefore its
          coverage score is Minimal, resulting in a Minimal score.

              Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that is run and
              is not included in an allow list. While publisher-based allow lists may fail to detect
              malicious executables with valid signatures, hash and path-based rules will still
              detect untrusted executables. Events are calculated once every twelve hours, so its
              temporal score is Partial.

          Once this control is activated, it generates alerts for any executable that is run and is
          not included in an allow list. While name and publisher-based allow lists may fail to
          detect malicious modifications to executable client binaries, hash-based rules will still
          detect untrusted executables. Events are calculated once every twelve hours, so its
          temporal score is Partial.
