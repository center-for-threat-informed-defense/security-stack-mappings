          Once this control is deployed, it can detect known vulnerabilities in Windows and various
          Linux endpoints. This information can be used to patch, isolate, or remove vulnerable
          software and machines. This control does not directly protect against exploitation and it
          is not effective against zero day attacks, vulnerabilities with no available patch, and
          software that may not be analyzed by the scanner. As a result, the score is capped at
          Partial.

  Once this control is deployed, it will run a scan every four hours and scans can be run on demand.
  Documentation notes that within 48 hours of the disclosure of a critical vulnerability, Qualys
  incorporates the information into their processing and can identify affected machines.

  All scores are capped at Partial since this control identifies vulnerabilities and does not
  address the detected vulnerabilities.
