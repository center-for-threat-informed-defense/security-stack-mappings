description: >-
  Multi-factor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for
  an additional form of identification, such as to enter a code on their cellphone or to provide a
  fingerprint scan.

  If you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If 
  the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, is it really the user signing in with the 
  username and password, or is it an attacker? When you require a second form of authentication,
  security is increased as this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to 
  obtain or duplicate.

          MFA provides significant protection against password compromises, requiring the adversary
          to complete an additional authentication method before their access is permitted.

              MFA can significantly reduce the impact of a password compromise, requiring the
              adversary to complete an additional authentication method before their access is permitted.

          This control only protects cloud accounts and therefore its overall protection coverage is
          Minimal.

              MFA can provide protection against an adversary that obtains valid credentials by
              requiring the adversary to complete an additional authentication process before access
              is permitted.  This is an incomplete protection measure though as the adversary may
              also have obtained credentials enabling bypassing the additional authentication
              method. 
comments: >-
  Note that MFA that is triggered in response to privileged operations (such as assigning a user a
  privileged role) are considered functionality of the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
  control.  Consult the mapping for this control for the ATT&CK (sub-)techniques it maps to.  This
  mapping specifically deals with MFA when it is enabled as a security default.
