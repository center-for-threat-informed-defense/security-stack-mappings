description: >-
  A password policy is applied to all user accounts that are created and managed directly in Azure
  Active Directory (AD). Some of these password policy settings can't be modified, though you can configure custom
  banned passwords for Azure AD password protection or account lockout parameters.

          This control provides partial protection for most of this technique's sub-techniques and
          therefore has been scored as Partial.

              The password restrictions provided by the default Password policy along with the
              lockout threshold and duration settings is an effective protection against this
              Password Guessing sub-technique.

              The password restrictions provided by the default Password policy can provide partial
              protection against password cracking but a determined adversary with sufficient
              resources can still be successful with this attack vector.

              In regards to Credential Stuffing, the password policy's lockout threshold can be
              partially effective in mitigating this sub-technique as it may lock the account before
              the correct credential is attempted.   Although with credential stuffing, the number
              of passwords attempted for an account is often (much) fewer than with Password
              Guessing reducing the effectiveness of a lockout threshold.  This led to its score
              being assessed as Partial rather than Significant (as was assessed for Password
              Guessing).
comments: >-
  Most scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases the strength of user
  passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful brute force attack.  But given
  sufficient resources, an adversary may still successfully execute the attack vectors included 
  in this mapping.
