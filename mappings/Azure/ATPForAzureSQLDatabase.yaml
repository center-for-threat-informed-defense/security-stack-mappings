  This control provides alerts for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse
  Analytics. An alert may be generated on suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities,
  and SQL injection attacks, as well as anomalous database access and query patterns.

          This control only provides alerts for a set of Azure database offerings. Databases that
          have been deployed to endpoints within Azure or third-party databases deployed to Azure do
          not generate alerts for this control.

              This control may alert on logon events that are suspicious. This includes logins from
              unusual locations, logins from suspicious IP addresses, and users that do not commonly
              access the resource. These alerts may limit the ability of an attacker to utilize a
              valid cloud account to access and manipulate Azure databases.

          This control may alert on extraction of a large amount of data to an unusual location. No
          documentation is provided on the logic for determining an unusual location.

          This control covers the majority of sub-techniques for this parent technique and may cover
          both successful and unsuccessful brute force attacks.
          This control only provides alerts for a set of Azure database offerings. Databases that
          have been deployed to endpoints within Azure or third-party databases deployed to Azure do
          not generate alerts for this control.

              This control may alert on repeated sign in attempts to the resource and successful
              logins from a suspicious location, IP address, or a user that does not commonly log in
              to the resource.  Because this control is specific to Azure database offerings, the
              detection coverage is Minimal.

          This control may alert on usage of faulty SQL statements. This generates an alert for a
          possible SQL injection by an application. Alerts may not be generated on usage of valid
          SQL statements by attackers for malicious purposes.
