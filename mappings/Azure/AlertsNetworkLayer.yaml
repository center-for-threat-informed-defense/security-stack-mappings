description: >-
  Security Center network-layer analytics are based on sample IPFIX data, which are packet headers
  collected by Azure core routers. Based on this data feed, Security Center uses machine learning
  models to identify and flag malicious traffic activities. Security Center also uses the Microsoft
  Threat Intelligence database to enrich IP addresses.

    technique-scores:
      - category: Detect
        value: Significant
        comments: >-
          This control can identify multiple connection attempts by external IPs, which may be
          indicative of Brute Force attempts, though not T1110.002, which is performed offline.
          It provides significant detection from most of this technique's sub-techniques and 
          procedure examples resulting in an overall score of Significant.

        comments: >-
          This control can identify connections to known malicious sites. Scored minimal since the
          malicious sites must be on block list.

          This control can potentially identify malicious use of remote services via alerts such as
          "Suspicious incoming RDP network activity" and "Suspicious Incoming SSH network activity".
comments: >-
  Associated with the Azure Security Center.

  The alerts can pick up outbound Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, though that's not an ATT&CK
  technique  per se (description oriented towards inbound DOS), also is a form of resource hijacking
  (though not in ATT&CK description, which is oriented towards cryptomining).
