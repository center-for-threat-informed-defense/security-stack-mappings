  File integrity monitoring (FIM), also known as change monitoring, examines operating system
  files, Windows registries, application software, Linux system files, and more, for changes that
  might indicate an attack. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) informs you when changes occur to
  sensitive areas in your resources, so you can investigate and address unauthorized activity.

          The detection score for this technique was assessed as Partial because it doesn't detect
          some of the sub-techniques of this technique such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
          Event Subscription and Trap sub-techniques. Additionally for some sub-techniques,

              The detection score for this group of sub-techniques is assessed as Minimal due to the
              accuracy component of the score. The registry keys which are modified as a result of
              these sub-techniques can change frequently or are too numerous to monitor and
              therefore can result in significant amount of false positives.

              This control can be used to monitor Registry keys related to security software or
              event logging processes that can detect when an adversary attempts to disable these
              tools via modifying or deleting Registry keys.  A majority of the cited procedure
              examples for this sub-technique are related to killing security processes rather than
              modifying the Registry, and therefore the detection coverage for this control is low.

comments: >
  The techniques included in this mapping result in Windows Registry or file system artifacts
  being created or modified which can be detected by this control.  

  The detection score for most techniques included in this mapping was scored as Significant and
  where there are exceptions, comments have been provided. This Significant score assessment  was
  due to the following factors: Coverage - (High) The control was able to detect most of the
  sub-techniques, references and procedure examples of the mapped techniques. Accuracy - (High)
  Although this control does not include built-in intelligence to minimize  the false positive rate,
  the specific artifacts generated by the techniques in this mapping do not change frequently and
  therefore the potential for a high false-positive is reduced.  Temporal - (Medium) This control at
  worst scans for changes on an hourly basis.
