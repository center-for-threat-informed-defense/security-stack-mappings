  File integrity monitoring (FIM), also known as change monitoring, examines  operating system
  files, Windows registries, application software, Linux  system files, and more, for changes that
  might indicate an attack. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) informs you when changes occur to
  sensitive  areas in your resources, so you can investigate and address unauthorized  activity.

          The detection score for this technique was assessed as Partial because it doesn't detect
          some of the sub-techniques of this technique such as Windows Management Instrumentation
          Event Subscription (WMI) and Trap sub-techniques.  Additionally for  some sub-techniques,
          this control can be noisy.

              The detection score for this group of sub-techniques is assessed as Minimal due to the
              accuracy component of the score.  The registry keys which are modified as a result of
              these sub-techniques can change frequently or are  too numerous to monitor and
              therefore can result in significant amount of false positives.

              Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings
              that can be monitored using this control.  Overall, there are numerous other bypass
              methods that do not result in Registry modification that this control will not be
              effect in detection resulting in a low detection coverage factor.

          This control is effective for detecting the Registry and file system artifacts that are
          generated during the execution of some variations of this technique while minimizing false
          positives due to the locations being monitored changing infrequently (e.g. /etc/pam.d/).

              This control can be used to detect the Windows Security Support Provider (SSP) DLLs

              This control can be used to monitor Registry keys related to security software or
              event logging processes that can detect when an adversary attempts to disable these
              tools via modifying or deleting Registry keys.  A majority of the cited procedure
              examples for this sub-technique are related to killing security processes rather than
              modifying the Registry, and therefore the detection coverage for this control is low.

              There are numerous ways depending on the operating system that these sub-techniques
              can be accomplished.  Monitoring the Windows Registry is one way depending on the

              This control can detect modifications made to the Registry keys used to register
              Windows Subject Interface Packages (SIPs) .  Because this sub-technique can be
              accomplished without modifying the Registry via DLL Search Order Hijacking, it has
              been scored as Partial.  The related Registry keys should change often and therefore

              This control can be used to detect when the system root certificates has changed by
              detecting the corresponding Registry or File system modifications that occur as a
              result.  These root certificates should not change often and therefore the false
              positive rate is minimal.
comments: >
  These techniques included in this mapping result in Windows Registry or file system artifacts
  being created or modified which can be detected by this control.  

  The detection score for most techniques included in this mapping was scored as Significant  and
  where there are exceptions, comments have been provided. This Significant score assessment  was
  due to the following factors: Coverage - (High) The control was able to detect most of the
  sub-techniques, references and procedure examples of the mapped techniques. Accuracy - (High)
  Although this control does not include built-in intelligence to minimize  the false positive rate,
  the specific artifacts generated by the techniques in this mapping  do not change frequently and
  therefore the potential for a high false-positive is reduced.  Temporal - (Medium) This control at
  worst scans for changes on an hourly basis.
