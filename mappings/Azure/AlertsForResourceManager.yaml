  Azure Defender for Resource Manager automatically monitors the 
  resource management operations in your organization, whether they're 
  performed through the Azure portal, Azure REST APIs, Azure CLI, or 
  other Azure programmatic clients. Alerts are generated by threats 
  detected in Azure Resource Manager logs and Azure Activity logs. 
  Azure Defender runs advanced security analytics to detect threats 
  and alert you about suspicious activity.
