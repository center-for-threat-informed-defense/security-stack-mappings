  Azure Defender for Storage can detect unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or
  exploit storage accounts. Security alerts may trigger when suspicious access patterns, suspicious
  activities, and upload of malicious content is detected. Alerts include details of the incident
  that triggered them, as well as recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.
  Alerts can be exported to Azure Sentinel or any other third-party SIEM or any other external tool.

          This control may alert on upload of possible malware or executable and Azure Cloud
          Services Package files. These alerts are dependent on Microsoft threat intelligence and
          may not alert on novel or modified malware.

          This control may alert on unusually large amounts of data being extracted from Azure
          storage and suspicious access to storage accounts. There are no alerts specifically tied
          to data transfer between cloud accounts but there are several alerts for anomalous storage
          access and transfer.

          This control may generate alerts when there has been an unusual or unexpected delete
          operation within Azure cloud storage. Alerts may not be generated by disabling of storage
          backups, versioning, or editing of storage objects.
