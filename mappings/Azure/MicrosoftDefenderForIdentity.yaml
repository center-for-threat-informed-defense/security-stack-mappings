              The following alert of this control is able to detect domain account discovery: 
              Account enumeration reconnaissance (external ID 2003).  This shouldn't occur
              frequently and therefore the false positive rate should be minimal.

              The Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) (external ID 2038) alert is also relevant
              and its machine learning capabilities should reduce the false positive rate.

              The User and IP address reconnaissance (SMB) (external ID 2012) alert can also provide
              a detection on a variation of this sub-technique.

          This control's Active Directory attributes reconnaissance (LDAP) (external ID 2210) alert
          may be able to detect this operation.  There are statements in the documentation for the

          critical information about the domain environment. This information can help attackers map
          the domain structure ...", that  may indicate support for detecting this technique.  The
          level of detection though is unknown and therefore a conservative assessment of a Minimal
          score is assigned.

              This control's Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) (external ID 2038) alert can
              be used to detect when an adversary "perform suspicious LDAP enumeration queries or
              queries targeted to sensitive groups that use methods not previously observed."  This
              alert employs machine learning which should reduce the number of false positives.

              Additionally, this control's User and Group membership reconnaissance (SAMR) (external
              ID 2021) alert can detect this sub-technique and also employs machine learning which
              should reduce the false-positive rate.

          attacker attempting to exploit CVE-2018-8626, a remote code execution vulnerability exists
          in Windows Domain Name System (DNS) servers.  In this detection, a Defender for Identity
          security alert is triggered when DNS queries suspected of exploiting the CVE-2018-8626
          security vulnerability are made against a domain controller in the network.  


          Likewise this controls Suspected SMB packet manipulation (CVE-2020-0796 exploitation)
          alert can detect a remote code execution vulnerability with SMBv3.


          Because these detections are specific to a few CVEs, its coverage is Minimal resulting in
          a Minimal score.

              This control's Suspicious communication over DNS (external ID 2031) alert can detect
              malicious communication over DNS used for data exfiltration, command, and control,
              and/or evading corporate network restrictions.  The accuracy of this control is
              unknown and therefore its score has been assessed as Partial.

          This control provides Partial detection for one of this technique's sub-techniques, while
          not providing any detection for the remaining, resulting in a Minimal score.

  Understandably (to avoid enabling the adversary to circumvent the detection), many of the
  detections provided by this control do not provide a detailed description of the detection logic
  making it often times difficult to map to ATT&CK Techniques.
