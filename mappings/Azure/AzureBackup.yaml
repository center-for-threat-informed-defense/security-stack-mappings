              Allows for recovery of disk content, though Disk structure wipes require additional
              procedures for recovery.
comments: >-
  Azure Backup service provides defense against destruction/manipulation of data at rest. Scoring as
  "Significant" since it is an essential practice against data destruction et al, though there is an argument
  for a Partial score since it does not prevent so much as enable recovery.
