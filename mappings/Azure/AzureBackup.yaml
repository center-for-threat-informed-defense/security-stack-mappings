              Allows for recovery of disk content, though Disk structure wipes require additional
              procedures for recovery.
comments: >-
  Azure Backup service provides defense against destruction/manipulation of data at rest. Scoring as
  "Significant" since it is an essential practice against data destruction et al, though argument
  for "partial" since does not prevent so much as enable recovery.
