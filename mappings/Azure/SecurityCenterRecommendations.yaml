          This control's recommendations related to enforcing the usage of the secure versions of
          the HTTP and FTP protocols (HTTPS and FTPS) can lead to encrypting traffic which reduces
          the ability for an adversary to gather sensitive data via network sniffing.  

          This also applies to the "Service Fabric clusters should have the ClusterProtectionLevel
          property set to EncryptAndSign", "Enforce SSL connection should be enabled for MySQL
          database servers", "Enforce SSL connection should be enabled for PostgreSQL database
          servers", "Only secure connections to your Redis Cache should be enabled" and "Secure
          transfer to storage accounts should be enabled" recommendations for their respective
          protocols.

          The "Usage of host networking and ports should be restricted" recommendation for
          Kubernetes clusters can also lead to mitigating this technique.

          These recommendations are limited to specific technologies on the platform and therefore
          its coverage score is Minimal.

          This control's CORS related recommendations can help lead to hardened web applications. 
          This can reduce  the likelihood of an application being exploited to reveal sensitive data
          that can lead to the compromise of an environment. 

          Likewise this control's recommendations related to keeping Java/PHP up to date for
          API/Function/Web apps can lead to hardening the public facing content that uses these
          runtimes.

          This control's recommendations related to disabling Public network access for Azure
          databases can lead to reducing the exposure of resources to the public Internet and
          thereby reduce the attack surface.

          These recommendations are limited to specific technologies (Java, PHP and CORS, SQL DBs)
          and therefore provide Minimal coverage leading to a Minimal score.

          This control provides recommendations for enabling Secure Boot of Linux VMs that can

          This control provides recommendations for limiting the CPU and memory resources consumed
          by a container to minimize resource exhaustion attacks.  Because this control only covers

                      to preventing resource exhaustion attacks by recommending enforcing limits for containers to 
                      ensure the runtime prevents the container from using more than the configured resource limit.

              This control's "Deprecated accounts should be removed from your subscription" and
              "Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription"
              recommendation can lead to removing accounts that should not be utilized from your
              subscriptions thereby denying adversaries the usage of these accounts to find ways to
              access your data without being noticed.  

              Likewise, the recommendations related to External account permissions can also
              mitigate this sub-technique.

              Because this is a recommendation and only limited to deprecated and external accounts,
              this is scored as Minimal.

          This control's "Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines" recommendation
          can lead to reducing the attack surface of your Azure VMs by recommending closing
          management ports.  Because this is a recommendation, its score is limited to Partial.

  Security Center recommendations include recommendations to enable security controls that have
  already been mapped separately (e.g. "Azure Defender for App Service should be enabled").   
  Rather than including the (sub-)techniques that these controls map to within this mapping, consult
  the mapping files for these controls.  To make this latter task easier, we have tagged all such
  controls with the "Azure Security Center Recommendation" tag.

  All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than
  applying/enforcing the recommended actions.

  IoT related recommendations were not included in this mapping.
