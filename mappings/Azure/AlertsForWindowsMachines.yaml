              This control may detect successful and failed brute force attempts with logic that
              factors the IP, time between attempts, and other suspicious activity. The following alerts may be
              generated:
              "A logon from a malicious IP has been detected", "A logon from a malicious IP has been detected.
              [seen multiple times]", "Successful brute force attack", "Suspicious authentication activity".

          This control provides detection for a minority of this technique's sub-techniques and procedure examples 
          resulting in a Minimal Coverage score and consequently an overall score of Minimal.  Furthermore, its detection
          capability relies on detecting the usage of specific tools (e.g. sqldumper.exe) further adversely impacting 
          its score.

              This control may detect when the registry is modified to allow logon credentials to be
              stored in clear text in LSA memory. This change allows a threat actor to gain plain
              text credentials from the host machine. The following alerts may be generated:
