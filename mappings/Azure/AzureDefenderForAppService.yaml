              Subdomain hijacking is a focus of this control, and its Dangling DNS detection alert
              feature is activated when an App Service website is decommissioned and its
              corresponding DNS entry is not deleted, allowing users to remove those entries before
              they can be leveraged by an adversary.

              This control analyzes host data to detect execution of known malicious PowerShell
              PowerSploit cmdlets. This covers execution of this sub-technique via the
              Find-AVSignature AntivirusBypass module on Windows, but does not address other
              procedures or platforms, and temporal factor is unknown, resulting in a Minimal score.

  The AppServices_KnownCredentialAccessTools alert is used to detect suspicious processes associated
  with credential theft. This is clearly linked to the Credential Access tactic, but does not
  clearly detect any specific technique or set of techniques, so it has been omitted from this
  mapping.
