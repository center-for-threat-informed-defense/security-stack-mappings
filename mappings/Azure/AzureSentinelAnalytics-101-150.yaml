              Can detect "Anomalous sign-in location by user account and authenticating application"
              as well as "Anomalous login followed by Teams action" at a default rate of once per
              day, based on the past 14 days of Azure Active Directory sign-in events. Can also
              detect a "GitHub Signin Burst from Multiple Locations" at a default rate of once per
              hour. Note that IP address location-based detection may result in a high false
              positive rate, and that misuse from a typical location is not covered. Can also detect
              "Sign-ins from IPs that attempt sign-ins to disabled accounts" which may indicate that
              use of the valid account(s) is malicious and a follow-up to a brute-force style
              technique.

              assessment of Azure Active Directory sign-in events and Okta console logins. Can also
              detect "Attempts to sign in to disabled accounts" and "Sign-ins from IPs that attempt
              sign-ins to disabled accounts" which may indicate attempts to brute force that include

              Can detect "User account created and deleted within 10 mins", which suggests the
              account may serve a malicious purpose, at a default frequency of once per day. Note
              that this only covers the case in which an adversary deletes the account within 10
              minutes of its creation. Local and domain account creation via "Powershell Empire
              cmdlets seen in command line" can also be detected.

          Can detect a "High count of connections by client IP on many ports" if a given client IP
          has 30 or more ports used within a 10 minute window, checked at a default frequency of
          once per hour. Note that false positives are probable based on changes in usage patterns
          and/or misconfiguration, and this detection only works if scanning is not spread out over
          a longer timespan. Scanning via "Powershell Empire cmdlets seen in command line" can also

          Can detect when "Several deny actions registered" due to Azure Firewall incidents,
          potentially indicating that an adversary is scanning resources on the network, at a
          default frequency of once per hour. Note that detection only occurs if the firewall
          prevents the scanning. Can also detect "Rare client observed with high reverse DNS lookup
          count" if a particular IP is observed performing an unusually high number of reverse DNS
          lookups and has not been observed doing so previously.

  Note: only mapped out of the box analytics. Did not score analytics that were specific ioc-based
  (e.g.  ip addresses or hashes ).  Did not score analytics that required a 3rd party integration
    (e.g. Alsid or TrendMicro). Refer to specific analytics by name in quotes.
