  Azure AD Password Protection provides a global banned password lists are
  automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant.  The Azure AD
  Identity Protection team constantly analyzes Azure AD security telemetry data
  looking for commonly used weak or compromised passwords.  When weak terms are
  found, they're added to the global banned password list. To support your own
  business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned 
  password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned 
  password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.

comments: >
  All scores have been assessed as Partial because this control increases the
  strength of user passwords thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful
  brute force attack.  Due to the fact that a user's password is not checked 
  against the banned list of passwords unless the user changes or resets their 
  password (which is an infrequent event), there is still ample opportunity 
  for attackers to utilize this technique to gain access. This is what prevented
  the score from being elevated to Significant.
