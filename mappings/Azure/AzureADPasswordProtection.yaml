  Azure AD Password Protection provides a global banned password lists are
  automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant.  The Azure AD
  Identity Protection team constantly analyzes Azure AD security telemetry data
  looking for commonly used weak or compromised passwords.  When weak terms are
  found, they're added to the global banned password list. To support your own
  business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned 
  password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned 
  password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.

            Increases the strength of user passwords thereby reducing the 
            likelihood of a successful brute force attack.
comments: >
  Due to the fact that a user's password is not checked against the banned list
  of passwords unless the user changes or resets their password (which occurs 
  infrequently), there is still ample opportunity for attackers to utilize this 
  technique to gain access. This reduces the effectiveness of this control and 
  consequently its score has been limited to partial.
