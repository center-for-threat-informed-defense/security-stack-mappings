  Azure AD Password Protection, default global banned password lists are
  automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant.  The Azure AD
  Identity Protection team constantly analyzes Azure AD security telemetry data
  looking for commonly used weak or compromised passwords.  When weak terms are
  found, they're added to the global banned password list. To support your own
  business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned 
  password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned 
  password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.

              Since this control is specifically designed to prevent a user from
              utilizing commonly used weak or compromised passwords, it directly
              addresses the weakness exploited by this technique. Furthermore,
              Microsoft makes the claim:  "Azure AD Password Protection 
              efficiently blocks all known weak passwords likely to be used in 
              password spray attacks."

              The global banned list of passwords utilized by this control is not 
              comprehensive but rather a curated list based on real-world 
              security telemetry on actual password attacks, therefore there
              is a possibility that leaked credentials not contained in the list
              may be successfully used in an attack.
comments: >
  Due to the fact that a user's password is not checked against the banned list
  of passwords unless the user changes or resets their password (which occurs 
  infrequently), there is still
  ample opportunity for attackers to utilize this technique to gain access.
  This reduces the effectiveness of this control and consequently its score has
  been limited to partial.
