  Azure DNS alias records are qualifications on a DNS record set. They can reference other Azure
  resources from within your DNS zone.   For example, you can create an alias record set that
  references an Azure public IP address instead of an A record. Your alias record set points to an
  Azure public IP address service instance dynamically. As a result, the alias record set seamlessly
  updates itself during DNS resolution.

          This control only provides protection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not
          providing any protection for the remaining and therefore its coverage score factor is
          Minimal, resulting in a Minimal score.

              Alias records prevent dangling references by tightly coupling the life cycle of a DNS
              record with an Azure resource. For example, consider a DNS record that's qualified as
              an alias record to point to a public IP address or a Traffic Manager profile. If you
              delete those underlying resources, the DNS alias record becomes an empty record set.
              It no longer references the deleted resource.  This control is effective for
              protecting DNS records that resolve to Azure resources but does not offer protection
              for records pointing to non-Azure resources, resulting in a Partial score.
