          Can identify "random" DNS occurences which can be associated with domain generation algorithm or Fast Flux
          sub-techniques.  Partial for coverage and accuracy (potential for false positive/benign).

              Detects "random" DNS name occurences, potentially indicative of Fast Flux or DGA.
              Potential false positives from benign "random" DNS names.

    technique-scores:
      - category: Detect
        value: Minimal
        comments: Can detect potential DNS protocol misuse/anomalies. 
                  Technique coverage is restricted to DNS and therefore results in a Minimal score.

            value: Significant
            comments: Can alert on anomalies and misuse of the DNS protocol.
  - id: T1572
    name: Protocol Tunneling
    technique-scores:
      - category: Detect
        value: Minimal
        comments: Can identify protocol misuse/anomalies in DNS.  Because this detection is specific to DNS, its coverage
                  score is Minimal resulting in an overall Minimal score.
  - id: T1090
    name: Proxy
    technique-scores:
      - category: Detect
        value: Minimal
        comments: Can detect DNS activity to anonymity networks e.g. TOR.  Because this detection is specific to DNS, 
                  its coverage score is Minimal resulting in an overall Minimal score.
  - id: T1048
    name: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
    technique-scores:
      - category: Detect
        value: Minimal
        comments: Can detect anomalous use of DNS.  Because this detection is specific to DNS, 
                  its coverage score is Minimal resulting in an overall Minimal score.
