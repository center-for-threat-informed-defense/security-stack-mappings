          This control can protect web applications from active scanning by an adversary. Because this protection
          is specific to web applications (although frequent targets) and not other application types,
          it has been scored as Partial.

          This control can protect web applications from network service scanning by an adversary.
          Because this protection is specific to web applications (although frequent targets) and
          not other application types enumerated in the procedure examples of this technique (e.g. Active Directory),
          it has been scored as Partial.
