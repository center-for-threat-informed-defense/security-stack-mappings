          This control may alert on suspicious Unix shell and PHP execution. Mismatched script
          extensions may also generate alerts of suspicious activity. Only one of the technique's
          sub-techniques is covered, resulting in a score of Minimal.

              This control may alert on suspicious commandline activity. Alerts may be generated on
              possible detection of shellcode usage on the commandline, based on arguments,
              location, user, etc.

              This control may alert on a suspicious shared object file being loaded as a kernel
              module. No documentation is provided on the logic but kernel module loading is a
              relatively rare event and can only be done with a small set of commands.

              This control may alert on the execution of hidden files. Since this control is only
              triggered on execution, it may not fire on a variety of hidden files or directories
              that are being utilized for malicious purposes.

              This control may alert on manipulation of the on-host firewall. Firewall rules should
              not be changed often in a standard environment and such an event can provide a high
              fidelity alert.

              This control may alert on activity which disables auditd logging on Linux endpoints.
              The auditd package may not be the only logging system being utilized and this control

              This control may alert on clearing of the command history file. Documentation is not
              provided on the logic for detecting when the command history is cleared but on Linux
