          This control may alert on suspicious Unix shell and PHP execution. Mismatched script
          extensions may also generate alerts of suspicious activity.

              This control may alert on a suspicious shared object file being loaded as a kernel
              module. No documentation is provided on the logic but kernel module loading is a
              relatively rare event and can only be done with a small set of commands.

              triggered on execution, it may not fire on a variety of hidden files or directories
              that are being utilized for malicious purposes.

              This control may alert on manipulation of the on-host firewall. Firewall rules should
              not be changed often in a standard environment and such an event can provide a high fidelity alert.

              This control may alert on activity which disables auditd logging on Linux endpoints.
              The auditd package may not be the only logging system being utilized and this control
              may not alert on activity that disables other logging software.

              This control may alert on clearing of the command history file. Documentation is not
              provided on the logic for detecting when the command history is cleared but on Linux
              machines the location of the history file tends not to change from the default.

          This control only provides detection coverage for the Compile After Delivery sub-technique while

              This control may alerts on SSH brute force attempts, addition of new SSH keys, and
              usage of a SSH server within a container. Alerts may not be generated by usage of

          This control may alert on suspicious container images running mining software or SSH
          servers. Privileged Docker containers and privileged commands running within containers
          may also be detected. These alerts are only generated on containers in Linux endpoint
          machines and not for containers running from Azure Docker deployment.
