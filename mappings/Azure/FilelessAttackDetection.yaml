  Fileless Attack Detection uses automated memory forensic techniques to identify fileless attack
  toolkits, techniques, and behaviors. This control periodically scans machines at runtime, and
  extracts insights directly from the memory of processes. Specific insights include the
  identification of known toolkits and crypto mining software, shellcode, and injected malicious
  executables in process memory. Alerts include descriptions with process metadata.
