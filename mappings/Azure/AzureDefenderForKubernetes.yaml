description: >-
  Azure Defender for Kubernetes provides cluster-level threat protection by monitoring your
  Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) managed services through the logs retrieved by AKS. Examples of
  security events that Azure Defender for Kubernetes monitors include exposed Kubernetes dashboards,
  creation of high privileged roles, and the creation of sensitive mounts.

          This control may alert on deletion of Kubernetes events. Attackers might delete those
          events for hiding their operations in the cluster. There is no relevant sub-technique for
          this control but the parent applies.
