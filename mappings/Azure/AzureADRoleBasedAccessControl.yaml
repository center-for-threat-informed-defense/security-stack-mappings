description: >+
  Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that is using
  the cloud. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure
  resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to.

          This control only provides protection for one of this technique's sub-techniques while not
          providing any protection for the remaining and therefore its coverage score factor is
          Minimal, resulting in a Minimal score.

          its coverage score factor is Partial, resulting in a Partial score.

          This control can be used to limit the number of users that have privileges to discover
          cloud infrastructure thereby reducing the attack surface.

          This control can be used to limit the number of users that have access to storage
          solutions except for the applications, users, and services that require access, thereby
          reducing the attack surface.

          This control can be used to limit the number of users that are authorized to grant consent
          to applications for accessing organizational data.  This can reduce the likelihood that a
          user is fooled into granting consent to a malicious application that then utilizes the
          user's OAuth access token to access organizational data.
comments: >-
  RBAC enables organizations to limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role
  that has administrative privileges.  This enables limiting the number of users within the tenant
  that have privileged access thereby resulting in a reduced attack surface and a coverage score
  factor of Partial.  Most sub-techniques have been scored as Partial for this reason.
