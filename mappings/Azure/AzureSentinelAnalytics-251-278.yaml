              Can detect "DNS events related to ToR proxies", which may indicate adversary use of
              Tor. Provides only minimal coverage because it only covers a set of common domains and
              is easily bypassed via hardcoded IP addresses, redirection, etc.

          Can detect "Multiple Password Reset by user" across Azure Active Directory, Office 365,
          and others via Security Events and Syslog. Does not specifically address sub-techniques,
          and has a potentially high false positive rate due to routine password changes.

          This control detects a highly specific behavior that applies to one sub-technique of this
          technique.

              Can detect "Azure DevOps - Retention Reduced to Zero", which may indicate that an
              adversary is looking to reduce their malicious activity's footprint by preventing
              retention of artifacts. Control is specific to indicators produced by Azure DevOps.

          Can detect "DNS events related to mining pools", which may indicate adversary use of
          resources to mine cryptocurrency. Provides only minimal coverage because it only covers a
          set of common domains and is easily bypassed via hardcoded IP addresses, redirection, etc.

              Can detect "Excessive Windows logon failures" which may indicate attempts to brute
              force Windows credentials.
