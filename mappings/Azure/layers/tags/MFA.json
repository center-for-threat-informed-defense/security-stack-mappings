Additionally, the same research shows that more than 99 percent of password spray and more than 97 percent of credential stuffing attacks use legacy authentication.\nThis control's \"Resolve unsecure account attributes\" recommendation can lead to detecting accounts with disabled (Kerberos) Preauthentication which can enable offline Password Cracking.\nBecause these are recommendations and do not actually enforce MFA, the assessed score is capped at Partial.
