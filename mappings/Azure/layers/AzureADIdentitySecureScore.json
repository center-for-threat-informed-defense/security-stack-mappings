Each improvement action in Identity Secure Score is tailored to your specific configuration.  The score helps you to:  Objectively measure your identity security posture, plan identity security improvements, and review the success of your improvements.  \nEvery 48 hours, Azure looks at your security configuration and compares your settings with the recommended best practices. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, a new score is calculated for your directory.",
