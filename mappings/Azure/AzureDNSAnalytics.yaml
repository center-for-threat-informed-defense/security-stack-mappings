  "DNS Analytics helps you to: identify clients that try to resolve malicious domain names,
  identify stale resource records, identify frequently queried domain names and talkative DNS clients, 
  view request load on DNS servers, and view dynamic DNS registration failures.

  The solution collects, analyzes, and correlates Windows DNS analytic and audit logs and other
  related data from your DNS servers."

  The temporal score for this control on most of the techniques and subtechnique is minimal, since it does not provide
  specific analytics itself (though can be used to provide data to other analytics after the fact. "The event-related
  data is collected near real time from the analytic and audit logs provided by enhanced DNS logging and diagnostics
  in Windows Server 2012 R2.".  Inventory-related data is uploaded every 48 hours.
