  You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources
  in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny
  inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources.
  For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.
