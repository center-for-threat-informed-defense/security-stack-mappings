description: >-
  You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources
  in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny
  inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources.
  For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

          This control can isolate portions of network that do not require network-wide access, limiting some
          attackers that leverage trusted relationships such as remote access for vendor

              This control can be used to restrict direct access to remote services to trusted networks.  This mitigates
              even an adversary with a valid account from accessing resources.  This can be circumvented though if an
              adversary is able to compromise a trusted host and move laterally to a protected network.  This results
              in an overall partial (coverage) score.

          This control can be used to restrict direct access to remote service gateways and concentrators that
          typically accompany external remote services.  This can be circumvented though if an
          adversary is able to compromise a trusted host and use it to access the external remote service.

          This control can restrict ports and inter-system / inter-enclave connections as described by the

              This control can be used to implement whitelist based network rules that can mitigate variations of
              this sub-techniques that result in opening closed ports for communication. Because this control
              is able to drop traffic before reaching a compromised host, it can effectively mitigate this port
              knocking sub-technique.
comments: >-
  Note: one can employ Application Security Groups (ASG) in Network Security Group (NSG) rules to map 
  rules to workloads etc. Not scoring ASG as a separate control. One can employ Adaptive Network Hardening (ANH) 
  to generate recommended NSG rules based on traffic, known trusted configuration, threat intelligence, and
  other inidcators of compromise. Not scoring ANH as a separate control.
