description: >-
  Azure Security Center identifies unmanaged containers hosted on IaaS Linux VMs, or other Linux
  machines running Docker containers. Security Center continuously assesses the configurations of
  these containers. It then compares them with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker
  Benchmark. Security Center includes the entire ruleset of the CIS Docker Benchmark and alerts you
  if your containers don't satisfy any of the controls. When it finds misconfigurations, Security
  Center generates security recommendations.

          This control may alert on Docker containers that are misconfigured or do not conform to
          CIS Docker Benchmarks. This may result in detection of container images implanted within
          Linux VMs with specific vulnerabilities or misconfigurations for malicious purposes.

              This control may provide recommendations to remove setuid and setguid permissions from
              container images. It may not be feasible to audit and remediate all binaries that have
              and require setuid and setguid permissions.

        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          This control may provide recommendations on how to reduce the surface area and mechanisms
          by which an attacker could escalate privileges.

        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          This control may recommend usage of TLS to encrypt communication between the Docker daemon
          and clients. This can prevent possible leakage of sensitive information through network
          sniffing.

        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          This control may provide recommendations to ensure sensitive host system directories are
          not mounted in the container.

            comments: >-
              This control may provide recommendations to ensure sshd is not running within Docker
              containers. This can prevent attackers from utilizing unmonitored SSH servers within
              containers. This may not prevent attackers from installing a SSH server in containers
              or hosts.

    name: Data from Local System
    technique-scores:
      - category: Protect
        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          This control may provide recommendations that limit the ability of an attacker to gain
          access to a host from a container, preventing the attacker from discovering and
          compromising local system data.
comments: 'All scores are capped at Partial since this control provides recommendations rather than
           applying/enforcing the recommended actions.'
