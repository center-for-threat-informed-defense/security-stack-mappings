  Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL
  Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual
  network.


  Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network.
  Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own
  private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers. Setup and
  consumption using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned, and shared
  partner services.

          Prevents DOS against systems that would otherwise need to connect via an
          internet-traversing path (coverage partial, since doesn't apply to systems that must be
          directly exposed to internet)

comments: >-
  This is a private network service, allowing connections between azure, on-prem, and 3rd party
  services without traversing the internet. Generally this reduces risk from MiTM, DOS,
  network-based data manipulation and network sniffing from untrusted network.
