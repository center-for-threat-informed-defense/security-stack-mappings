description: >-
  Azure Defender for container registries includes a vulnerability scanner to scan the images in
  your Azure Resource Manager-based Azure Container Registry registries and provide deeper
  visibility into your images' vulnerabilities. The integrated scanner is powered by Qualys. Azure
  Container Registry is a managed, private Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker
  Registry 2.0.

          This control may provide provide information about vulnerabilities within container
          images. The limited scope of containers and registries that are applicable to this control
          contribute to the lower score.

          This control may prevent adversaries from implanting malicious container images through
          fine grained permissions and use of container image tag signing. Image tag signing allows
          for verifiable container images that have been signed with legitimate keys.

        comments: >-
          This control may scan and alert on import or creation of container images with known
          vulnerabilities or a possible expanded surface area for exploitation.
comments: >-
  This mapping file covers Docker container registries security features along with the Azure
  Defender for Container Registries scanner. The scanning capability of the control is only
  available for Linux images in registries accessible from the public internet with shell access
  which limits the general applicability.
