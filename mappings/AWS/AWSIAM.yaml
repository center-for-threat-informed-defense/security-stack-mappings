  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access
  to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has
  permissions) to use resources.

              This control may mitigate the impact of compromised valid accounts by enabling
              fine-grained access policies and implementing least-privilege policies. MFA 
              can provide protection against an adversary that obtains valid credentials by
              requiring the adversary to complete an additional authentication process before
              access is permitted.

              The Access Analyzer tool may detect when an external entity has been granted access to
              cloud resources through use of access policies. This tool will scan upon any change to
              access policies or periodically within 24 hours.

          This control may generate logs for creation and manipulation of accounts but the relevant
          security information would be handled by another security control.

              This control may mitigate against application access token theft if the application is
              configured to retrieve temporary security credentials using an IAM role. This
              recommendation is a best practice for IAM but must be explicitly implemented by the
              application developer.

              This control may mitigate brute force attacks by enforcing multi-factor
              authentication, enforcing strong password policies, and rotating credentials
              periodically. These recommendations are IAM best practices but must be explicitly
              implemented by a cloud administrator.

          Limit IAM permissions to discover cloud infrastructure in accordance with least privilege. Organizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.
