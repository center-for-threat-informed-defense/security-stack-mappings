  Secret Manager allows you to store, manage, and access secrets as binary blobs or text strings.
  Secret Manager works well for storing configuration information such as database passwords, API
  keys, or TLS certificates needed by an application at runtime.

          This control can provide protection against attackers stealing application access tokens
          if they are stored within Secret Manager. Secret Manager significantly raises the bar for
          access of stored tokens by requiring legitimate credentials with proper authorization.
          Applications may have to be modified to take advantage of Secret Manager and may not
          always be possible to utilize.

          This control may provide a more secure location for storing passwords. If an cloud user
          account, endpoint, or application is compromised, they may have limited access to
          passwords stored in Secret Manager.

          This control provides a central, secure location for storage of credentials to reduce the
          possibility of attackers discovering unsecured credentials.

          This control provides secure methods for accessing secrets and passwords. This can reduce
          the incidents of credentials and other authentication material being transmitted in
          clear-text or by insecure encryption methods. Any communication between applications or
          endpoints after access to Secret Manager may not be secure.
