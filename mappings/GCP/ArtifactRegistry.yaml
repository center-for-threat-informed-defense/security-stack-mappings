          Once this control is deployed, it can detect known vulnerabilities in various Linux OS
          packages. This information can be used to patch, isolate, or remove vulnerable software
          and machines. This control does not directly protect against exploitation and is not
          effective against zero day attacks, vulnerabilities with no available patch, and other
          end-of-life packages.

          Once this control is deployed, it can detect variations to store system packages and
          images stored in the repository, which adversaries may target to establish persistence
          while evading cyber defenses.

          Once this control is deployed, it can detect known OS package vulnerabilities in various
          Linux OS packages that could be used to escalate privileges and execute adversary-controlled
          code (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, National Vulnerability Database)
