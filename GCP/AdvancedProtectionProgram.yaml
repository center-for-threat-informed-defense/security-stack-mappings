  The Advanced Protection Program safeguards users with high visibility and sensitive information
  from targeted online attacks.  Current capabilities include MFA, blocking harmful downloads while
  using chrome, and prevention of data requests from non-vetted apps.


  New protections are automatically added to defend against todayâ€™s wide range of threats.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. This provides significant protection against unauthorized users from
          accessing and manipulating accounts to retain access.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. Enabling Advanced Protection Program for all users at an organization can
          prevent adversaries from maintaining access via created accounts because any accounts they
          create won't have the required security keys for MFA.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. Restricting access via MFA provides significant protection against
          adversaries accessing data objects from cloud storage.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. Enabling MFA reduces the usefulness of usernames and passwords that may be
          collected via email since adversaries won't have the associated security keys to gain
          access.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. Enabling MFA for remote service accounts can mitigate an adversary's
          ability to leverage stolen credentials since they won't have the respective security key
          to gain access.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. Integrating multi-factor authentication as part of organizational policy
          can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may
          be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting
          information.

          Advanced Protection Program enables the use of a security key for multi-factor
          authentication. Implementing MFA on remote service logons prevents adversaries from using
          valid accounts to access those services.
