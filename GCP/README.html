            <h1>Google Cloud Platform Security Control Mappings to MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</h1>
<p>These mappings of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) security controls to MITRE ATT&amp;CK® are designed to empower organizations with independent data on which native GCP security controls are most useful in defending against the adversary TTPs that they care about. These mappings are part of a collection of mappings of native product security controls to ATT&amp;CK based on a common methodology, scoring rubric, data model, and tool set. This full set of resources is available on the Center’s project <a href="https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/gcp/">page</a>.</p>

<td align="left">Minimal</td>
<td align="left">Actifio provides encryption in transit for data traveling between Actifio appliances, Actifio and VMware environments, and for data traversing the control channel utilizing the Actifio connector. This provides significant protection against Network Sniffing since adversaries would be unable to read encrypted traffic. However, Actifio only encrypts data in transit that interacts with Actifio components, rather than all traffic for a system. This is also only relevant when traffic is being backed up, which is a small amount of the time. In this case, it has been given a rating of Minimal.</td>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/gcp_icon.svg" /> 16. Cloud IDS</h2>
<p>Cloud IDS is an intrusion detection service that inspects network traffic and triggers alerts to intrusions, malware, spyware, or other cyber-attacks. Cloud IDS' default ruleset is powered by Palo Alto Network's advanced threat detection technologies and the vendor's  latest set of threat signatures (e.g., antivirus, anti-spyware, or vulnerability signatures). Cloud IDS is dependent on Cloud logging feature to collect network telemetry. Further threat detection rule can be crafted to generate alerts based on network traffic (e.g., PCAP, Netflow).</p>

<li><a href="layers/CloudIDS.json">Navigator Layer</a> (<a href="layers/CloudIDS.json">JSON</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This mapping was scored as significant due to the control’s notable detection accuracy, mappable threat coverage, and time-related factors (e.g., real-time).<br />
The cyber-attacks mapped are considered a subset of the most notable threat detection available for Cloud IDS, but a thorough mapping to all of Palo Alto Network's advanced threat detection technologies wasn't possible due to constant updates, 3rd party vendor's extensive documentation, and new threat signatures.  </p>

<p>Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows user to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events from Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.  User can collect logging data from over 150 common application components, on-premises systems, and hybrid cloud systems.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This control is not mappable because it does not provide significant detection of malicious techniques. Some of the other security controls that this control maps to are Azure DNS Analytics, AWS CloudTrail, AWS S3, and AWS Audit Manager. The S3 server access logging feature was not mapped because it was deemed to be a data source that can be used with other detective controls rather than a security control in of itself.  </p>

VPC firewalls are stateful and exist not only between your instances and other networks, but also between individual instances within the same network. Connections are allowed or denied on a per-instance basis.  Firewall activity can be captured via Firewall rules logging and analyzed with Firewall Insights.</p>

<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>Documentation is segmented into 4 sections: VPC Firewall rules, Hierarchical firewall policies, Firewall insights, Firewall rules logging. These sections are listed under Firewall Insights and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) rather than a generic Firewall documentation page. Its unclear if the data in these sections should correspond to the "Firewalls" control, or the parent control under which its documented.  </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/gcp_icon.svg" /> 33. Identity and Access Management</h2>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) gives administrators fine-grained access control and visibility for centrally managing enterprise cloud resources. It gives more granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets users adopt the security principle of least privilege, so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.</p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/gcp_icon.svg" /> 40. Security Command Center</h2>
<p>Security Command Center (SCC) provides analysts with a centralized dashboard for cyber situational awareness by aggregating threat and vulnerability reports. SCC works by scanning for weaknesses or monitoring an organization's logging stream for anomalies (e.g., Google Workspace logs, containers, vulnerabilities in web applications, and hypervisor-level instrumentation). To further mitigate risks in the infrastructure, SCC easily integrates with other Google Cloud security solutions: Cloud DLP, Chronicle, Binary Authorization, Cloud Armor, and 3rd party solutions (e.g., SIEM, SOAR). The cyber-attacks in this solution are correlated to SCC's premium tier which included additional security features for: Event Threat Detection, Container Threat Detection, Virtual Machine Threat Detection, Web Security Scanner, and Security Health Analytics</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="layers/SCC.json">Navigator Layer</a> (<a href="layers/SCC.json">JSON</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This mapping was rated as significant due to the control’s notable detection accuracy, mappable threat coverage, and time-related factors (e.g., real-time).</p>
<p>SCC also provides users with compliance mappings that scan environments against violations according to PCI-DSS v3.2.1, OWASP Top Ten, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001. </p>
<p>To improve cyber-situational awareness and detection against various threats, SCC ingests logging data from multiple sources. Cloud Audit Admin Activity logs are always enabled by default and cannot be disabled. SCC Premium consumes logs automatically when activated. SSH Logs and syslog inform the brute force detector, and the set of network logs (VPC Flow/Cloud Firewall/Cloud NAT/Cloud DNS).</p>
<p>Further automated response functionality can be extended in SCC to take actions against threats. A full list of automated actions can be found on GCP's GitHub.</p>

<p>Terraform is an open source tool that lets you provision Google Cloud resources with declarative configuration files—resources such as virtual machines, containers, storage, and networking.

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>In its current state, this control was scored as not mappable as it does not look reasonable to correlate to specific (sub-) techniques of MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK.</p>
<p>While Terraform provides some security capabilities specific to Terraform processes (encryption between Terraform Clients, encrypting workspace variables, <br />
Isolation between Terraform executions and Cloud tenants) the capabilities don't necessarily benefit the entire organization. Terraform's primary function is to support the provisioning of Google resources with configuration management. Therefore, this control has been identified as not-mappable.  </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/gcp_icon.svg" /> 49. Web Risk</h2>
<p>Web Risk is a Google Cloud service that lets client applications check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Unsafe web resources include social engineering sites—such as phishing and deceptive sites—and sites that host malware or unwanted software. With the Web Risk, you can quickly identify known bad sites, warn users before they click infected links, and prevent users from posting links to known infected pages from your site.</p>
